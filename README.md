## **Key Features** 🌟
- **Student Dashboard:** 🧑‍🎓
  - Face registration and authentication for secure attendance. 📸
  - Attendance marking with real-time location verification using BLE signal detection. 📍
  
- **Teacher Dashboard:** 👩‍🏫
  - Create classrooms with unique BLE signal identifiers for attendance sessions. 🏫
  - Manage and track attendance records. 📊

- **Backend:** 🔙
  - Python-powered face recognition using the `face_recognition` library. 🐍
  - PHP scripts for secure database interactions. 💻

- **Security:** 🔒
  - Multi-layer verification to prevent proxy attendance. 🚫
  - SQL injection prevention with prepared statements in PHP. 🛡️

## **Setup and Installation** ⚙️
### **Prerequisites** 📋
- Flutter installed on your system 📱
- Python 3.9+ with required libraries (`face_recognition`, `dlib`, `numpy`, `celery`) 🐍
- MySQL Server 🗃️
- PHP and a web server (Apache) 💻
- Redis or RabbitMQ for Celery task management 🔄

### **Steps** 📝
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-attendance-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Flutter_Attendance/lib
   ```
3. Set up the backend:
   - Configure the PHP scripts in the `/lib/API` directory with your MySQL credentials. it also have `Schemas.txt` for database schemas.🗂️
   
   - Install Python dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
   - Start Redis on UBUNTU
      ```bash
      sudo service redis-server start
      ```
   - Start the Celery worker:
      ```bash
      celery  -A celery_tasks.tasks worker --loglevel=info -E
      ```
   - Start Apache server in it start MySQL, Apache 🌐
4. Run the frontend:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    flutter run
    ```
